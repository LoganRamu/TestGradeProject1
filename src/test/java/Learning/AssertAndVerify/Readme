Assertion:
Hard assertion- Assert
Soft assertion- Verify

Both Junit and TestNG frameworks have assertion
- Since Junit is unit test framework doesn't have Soft assert (verify) in built
    -if we need we have to import org.assertj.core.api
    -Its called fluent assert
- TestNG functional testing framework it have both Hard assert and soft assert in  util

Soft Assert :
-Soft Assert is used to verify the all Assert results at the end.
-Soft Assert records failure not throwing exception

When softassert.assertAll(); calls then throw the exception atlease one assert fails
