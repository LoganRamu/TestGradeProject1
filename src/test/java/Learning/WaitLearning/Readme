-Explicit wait is dynamic wait
-We can use both imp wait and exp wait at a time

Fluent wait:
-We can set the polling time
-Reduce the burden of default polling
-We can set how iften compilet should check for element within the given time


------

Thread.sleep(5000);

Wait for 5 seconds eventhough the element is present in 2 secs

Implicit wait:
Pros: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
if the element found in 1st sec, go for next step in code
is wait untill element preset in DOM, not wait for interact
Only check whether the element present in DOM
Static, no condition
